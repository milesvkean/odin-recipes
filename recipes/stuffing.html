    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>My little sister asked if I had any requests for Thanksgiving where she 
        usually cooks mostly African food. I said stuffing. She apparently
        had never made it before but it turned out incredibly good, the best I've ever had.
        And here is her recipe.
