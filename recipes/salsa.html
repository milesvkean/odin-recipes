    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>I was searching for salsa recipes online and none of them seemed quite right so I asked my friend from Mexico how she
    makes it.
    Without hesitation she sent me the following recipe and I love it. It's nice and spicy. Very healthy and addictive.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>7 tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 serrano peppers</li>
        <li>1 large clove garlic</li>
        <li>cilantro</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>lime</li>
        <li>1/4 of an onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the tomatoes, serrano peppers, and garlic clove in a pot of water and bring to a boil until the tomato skins start to peel</li>
        <li>Place all items in a blender</li>
    </ol>
