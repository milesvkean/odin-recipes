    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>I learned this from my Italian roommates in New York. They call it 'nothing' pasta cause there's barely any ingredients 
        but if you cook it right it's amazing.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 to 6 plump garlic cloves</li>
        <li>½ cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Sea salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>3 to 4 anchovy fillets, coarsely chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>1 small dried hot red chili pepper, crumbled, or 1/2 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes or more to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup minced flat-leaf parsley</li>
    </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring 5 to 6 quarts water to rolling boil. </li>
            <li>Peel garlic cloves, removing green sprout at center, if necessary, and chop coarsely. In pan large enough to hold all
            the drained pasta, cook garlic in oil very gently over medium-low heat. Cook just until garlic softens and starts to
            turn golden. Do not brown. </li>
            <li>Add at least 2 tablespoons salt to vigorously boiling water. Add spaghetti, stirring. </li>
                        <li>If using anchovies, add them to oil and garlic. Cook briefly, mashing anchovy pieces into oil with fork. Stir in
                        chili pepper and half of the parsley, and carefully add a ladleful of the pasta cooking water. Let simmer, and reduce
                        slightly while pasta finishes cooking. </li>
                        <li>Start testing pasta after it has cooked for 4 minutes. When it is still a little chewy in the center, drain and add
                        it to pan with sauce. Turn heat up slightly, and cook, mixing pasta and sauce together well for 1 to 2 minutes, or until
                        pasta is done to taste. Turn pasta into preheated serving bowl, sprinkle with remaining minced parsley, and serve
                        immediately. </li>

        </ol>
